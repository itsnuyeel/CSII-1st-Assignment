# CSII-1st-Assignment

This repository contains the solutions for the first assignment of the CS-II course with professor Marco Zecchini at University of Rome "La Sapienza".

The repository is based on ROSALIND and it's structured as follows:

## Bioinformatics Stronghold

From Bioinformatics Stronghold: dna (ex1), rna (ex2), revc (ex3), iprb (ex4), fib (ex5), gc (ex6), prot (ex7), subs (ex8), hamm (ex9).

Example of python file name: bs-ex1-dna.py

The corresponding datasets can be found in the "datasets-pt1" folder.

## Algorithmic Heights

From Algorithmic Heights: ins (ex1), mer (ex2), par (ex3), par3 (ex4), med (ex5), qs (ex6), hea (ex7), hs (ex8), ps (ex9).

Example of python file name: ah-ex1-ins.py

The corresponding datasets can be found in the "datasets-pt2" folder.

Furthermore, for simplicity a jupyter notebook of each part is also provided where each cell corresponds to an exercise solution.
